Welcome to my Plex stack repository! This repository showcases my Docker Compose setup for managing various media-related services using Docker containers. The compose file is meant to be changed to each users liking as I know not everyone has the same requirements. Hope you enjoy!

Currently you can choose from the **Basic** or the **Advanced** compose

## Overview

**Basic Compose** Includes:

- **Plex:** Media server for streaming movies and TV shows.
- **Radarr:** Movie management and automation.
- **Sonarr:** TV show management and automation.
- **Prowlarr:** Indexer manager for Radarr and Sonarr.
- **Overseerr:** Request management and monitoring for Plex.
- **Qbittorrent:** BitTorrent client with VPN support.

**Advanced Compose** Includes:

- **Plex:** Media server for streaming movies and TV shows.
- **Radarr:** Movie management and automation.
- **Sonarr:** TV show management and automation.
- **Prowlarr:** Indexer manager for Radarr and Sonarr.
- **Overseerr:** Request management and monitoring for Plex.
- **Qbittorrent:** BitTorrent client with VPN support.
- **Tdarr:** Pre-transcodes your media to decrease file sizes
- **Membarr:** Invite users to your Plex via discord
- **Tautulli:** Analytics and monitoring for Plex.
- **Bazarr:** Subtitle management for movies and TV shows.
- **Autobrr:** Used to grab torrents immediately as they are released.
- **Readarr:** Used to grab books and audiobooks.
- **Lidarr:** Used to grab music.
- **Flaresolverr:** Used as a proxy server to bypass Cloudflare and DDoS-GUARD protection.
- **Dozzle:** Used to view the logs of any container.
- **Wizarr:** Used to create links that can be sent to users so they can be invited to your media server.
- **Plex Meta Manager:** Used to create collections, overlays, playlists and much more!

- **Recylarr:** Used to sync the config of trash guides with your arr stack


## Dependencies

1. Linux
2. Docker / Docker Compose
3. OPTIONAL: Portainer - Docker GUI

## How to Use

1. Clone this repository / Copy the docker-compose.yml file:

   ```
   git clone https://github.com/DonMcD/ultimate-plex-stack.git
   ```
2. Rename the advanced-compose or basic-compose to docker-compose.yml
3. Fill in the required environment variables
5. Then enter the command ``` docker compose up -d ```
6. OPTIONAL: Setup a reverse proxy so you can use radarr.my-domain.com instead of 192.168..... to access each of your apps

## Example of Environment variables in Portainer
Keep in mind some variable names have changed since this screenshot was taken

File location examples:
- {MEDIA_SHARE} = /share
- {BASE_PATH} = /home/username/docker

To allow hardlinking to work (which you will definitely want!) you will have to use the same root folder in all of your container path. In this example we use "/share", so in the container it will look like "/share/downloads/tv"

An example of my folder structure:  
![image](https://github.com/DonMcD/ultimate-plex-stack/assets/90471623/2003ac26-a929-4ff6-ad67-e35fc51fb51a)
  
- Feel free to expand your folders to also include "books" or "music" as you need for your setup
  

  
1. In Radarr you will want to set your category to "movies", this will create the movies folder
2. In Sonarr you will want to set your category to "tv", this will create the tv folder

  
Anytime you reference your media folder in a container you want the path to look like /share/media/tv instead of /tv like a lot of the default guides say, if you do end up mapping the path as /tv hardlinking will not work

## Possible Additions

1. Organizr - Creates a lovely dashboard to help navigate to all of your apps
2. Portainer - Docker GUI
3. UptimeKuma - Gives you the ability to monitor your services
